  <p>ROSY is a research group affiliated with the School of Environmental Science & Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).</p>
  <p>Mission: Environmental changes and climate change are and will continue influencing the human society. We are experiencing a changing world with increase in water demand and enhanced water cycle. We believe that our understanding of and community-based adaptation to these changes must be informed by scientific research. The overall research goal is to contribute to a better understanding of the hydrological processes, and accurately monitoring the availability of water resources, and to put forward potential solutions to the related environmental problems. Therefore, our group will develop and utilize models and Earth Observations (EO) to understand, simulate, and predict the hydrological/hydraulic behaviors at different scales. </p>

<h4>About Me</h4>

My research interests lie in the fileds of hydrology and remote sensing. I am particularly interested  in <strong style="color:red;">earth observations (EO)</strong> of key variables of the water cycle. How to exploit EO data to advance our knowledge of the hydrological processes, and to accurately monitoring flood and drought, etc. has always driven me forward. I have studied lake level variations, river level retrieval, and simulating river hydrodynamics using these data. 

I completed my PhD in September 2018 in the Department of Environmental Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). My PhD thesis was titled <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/exploiting-cryosat-2-altimetry-for-surface-water-monitoring-and-m" style="color: red;font-weight:bold;">Exploiting CryoSat-2 Altimetry for Surface Water Monitoring and Modelling</a>. My supervisors were <font color="red">Professor Peter Bauer-Gottwein</font> and <font color="red">Professor Ole B. Andersen</font>. Since October 2018, I am a postdoctoral researcher at DTU and work on two projects, i.e. EOForChina and ChinaWaterSense.

I will be starting an assistant professor position at SUSTech from March 2021. Exploring the potentials offered by the big EO data for hydrological research is one of my focuses.
