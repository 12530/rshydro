  <p>ROSY is a research group affilicated with the School of Environmental Science & Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).</p>
  <p>Mission: Environmental changes and climate change are and will continue influencing the human society. We are experiencing a changing world with increase in water demand and enhanced water cycle. We believe that our understanding of and community-based adaptation to these changes must be informed by scientific research. The overall research goal is to contribute to a better understanding of the hydrological processes, and accurately monitoring the availability of water resources, and to put forward potential solutions to the related environmental problems. Therefore, our group will develop and utilize models and Earth Observation (EO) to understand, simulate, and predict the hydrological/hydraulic behaviors at different scales. </p>

About me

My research interests lie in the fileds of hydrology and remote sensing. I am particularly interested  in earth observations (EO) of key variables of the water cycle. How to exploit EO data to advance our knowledge of the hydrological processes, and to accurately monitoring flood and drought, etc.? I have studied lake level variations, river level retrieval, and simulating river hydrodynamics using these data. 

I completed my PhD in September 2018 in the Department of Environmental Engineering at the Technical University of Demark (DTU). 
Here at SUSTech, exploring the potentials offered by the big EO data for hydrological research is one of my focuses.
