  <p>ROSY is a research group affilicated with the School of Environmental Science & Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).</p>
  <p>Mission: Environmental changes and climate change are and will continue influencing the human society. We are experiencing a changing world with increase in water demand and enhanced water cycle. We believe that our understanding of and community-based adaptation to these changes must be informed by scientific understanding. The overall research goal is to contribute to a better understanding of the processes and issues of hydrology & water resources, and to put forward potential solutions to the related environmental problems. Therefore, our group will develop and utilize models and Earth Observation (EO) to understand and predict the hydrological/hydraulic behaviors. </p>
